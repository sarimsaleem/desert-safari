You don’t need any skills to enjoy. However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Firstly, look for a comfortable sandboard. Secondly, look for tall and steep dunes as they are easy. Now strap your feet and slide down the dune. If you are still afraid, you can begin with sit-down sandboarding on a small dune. Sandboarding isn’t difficult at all; you need to start.
